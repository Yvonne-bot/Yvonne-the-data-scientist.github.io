Projects

Attention-Based CNN-LSTM for Respiratory Sound Classification

Built deep learning models to classify respiratory sounds using the ICBHI 2017 dataset. Implemented CNN, CNN-LSTM, and attention-based CNN-LSTM architectures trained on log-Mel spectrograms. Addressed class imbalance and improved robustness through data augmentation. Applied LIME to explain model predictions and highlight diagnostically relevant regions.

Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, CNN, LSTM, Attention, Audio Signal Processing, LIME  

Impact: Improved performance over baseline models and demonstrated interpretable deep learning for healthcare decision support.

Netflix Content Analysis, Text Classification, and Similarity Modelling

Developed scalable NLP pipelines to analyse over 8,000 Netflix titles. Applied text preprocessing and TF-IDF feature engineering for supervised classification and content similarity modelling using cosine similarity. Built PySpark-based workflows and visualised insights using Tableau.

Tools: Python, PySpark, NLP, TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, Scikit-learn, Tableau  

Impact: Demonstrated large-scale text analytics and content similarity modelling using big data tools.

Maternal Health Risk Classification Using Machine Learning

Applied machine learning models to predict maternal health risk levels using clinical indicators. Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE and evaluated models with stratified cross-validation. Tree-based and ensemble models achieved the strongest results.

Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, XGBoost, SMOTE  

Impact: Showed how machine learning can support risk identification in maternal healthcare contexts.
