## Projects

### Attention-Based CNN-LSTM for Respiratory Sound Classification

Developed and evaluated deep learning models for automated respiratory sound classification using the ICBHI 2017 dataset. The project focused on addressing real-world challenges in healthcare AI, including class imbalance, environmental noise, and limited model interpretability.

Implemented CNN, CNN-LSTM, and attention-based CNN-LSTM architectures trained on log-Mel spectrograms to capture both spectral and temporal characteristics of respiratory cycles. Robustness was improved through data augmentation, and explainability was introduced using LIME to analyse model decision behaviour.

**Strengths demonstrated:**  
Deep learning model design · Research-style evaluation · Explainable AI · Healthcare-focused ML

### Netflix Content Analysis, Text Classification, and Similarity Modelling

Applied big data analytics and natural language processing techniques to analyse over 8,000 Netflix titles. This project explored how large-scale textual metadata can support content classification and recommendation-style similarity modelling.

Built scalable PySpark pipelines for text preprocessing and TF-IDF feature extraction, trained supervised classification models, and implemented cosine similarity to identify related content. Insights were communicated through Tableau dashboards to support exploratory analysis and stakeholder understanding.

**Strengths demonstrated:**  
Big data processing · NLP feature engineering · Scalable ML pipelines · Data visualisation

### Maternal Health Risk Classification Using Machine Learning

Developed and evaluated machine learning models to predict maternal health risk levels (Low, Mid, High) using routinely collected clinical indicators. The project emphasised responsible model development for decision-support use in healthcare contexts.

Compared classical and ensemble learning approaches, addressed class imbalance using SMOTE, and applied stratified cross-validation for robust evaluation. Model performance and limitations were analysed with explicit consideration of ethical use and real-world deployment constraints.

**Strengths demonstrated:**  
Classical ML · Imbalanced data handling · Model evaluation · Ethical and responsible AI
